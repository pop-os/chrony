  As a special exception, you may create a larger work that contains
  part or all of the Bison parser skeleton and distribute that work
  under terms of your choice, so long as that work isn't itself a
  parser generator using the skeleton or a modified version thereof
  as a parser skeleton.  Alternatively, if you modify or redistribute
  the parser skeleton itself, you may (at your option) remove this
  special exception, which will cause the skeleton and the resulting
  Bison output files to be licensed under the GNU General Public
  License without this special exception.
  .  
  This special exception was added by the Free Software Foundation in
  version 2.2 of Bison.

  C LALR(1) parser skeleton written by Richard Stallman, by
  simplifying the original so-called "semantic" parser.

  All symbols defined below should begin with yy or YY, to avoid
  infringing on user name space.  This should be done even for local
  variables, as they might otherwise be expanded by user macros.
  There are some unavoidable exceptions within include files to
  define necessary library symbols; they are noted "INFRINGES ON
  USER NAME SPACE" below.
